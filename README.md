Optimized self-populated language-learning application. Implementing the SuperMemo algorithm.

This application aims to solve two key aspects of learning language (though may be biased towards an english-speaker like me): Character recognition and phrase recognition, along with phonetic accompaniment to for the two.

The process is catered towards my own learning (mainly Spanish, Indonesian, and Japanese), but will carry usability to others beyond my own understanding.

Documents (phrases, words, or characters/letters) will be shown based on their i (interval) value, and can be filtered based on given key categories.

If this project was to gain traction (not its main intent), content addition, in a Duolingo-esque sense will be quite useful. 

But as mentioned previously, since it is aimed towards my own understanding, things like Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji libraries will exist statically on the site, unlike user-specific "cards", which get populated in the same way as Anki functions.
